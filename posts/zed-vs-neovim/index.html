Why Zed caught my attention 🤩
Zed is fast. Like, really fast. But so is Neovim, so that&rsquo;s not the selling point.
What made me curious:

Simpler config - No more debugging why a plugin broke after an update
Great vim emulation - Actually usable, not an afterthought
Built-in features - Remote dev via SSH, REPL integration, debugging - all just work
AI integration - Native, not bolted on through five different plugins
Collaborative coding - Finally, pair programming without screen sharing lag

The development pace is impressive. New releases with meaningful content every week. And it&rsquo;s open source.">

Zed’s team ships fixes fast. Issues that annoyed me before are already resolved: window resize with keyboard, terminal splits, completion menu scrolling, diff view, slow Neovim in Zed terminal, and vim marks as bookmarks.\nThe real problem with Neovim 💔 It’s not Neovim itself. It’s the ecosystem.\nThe LazyVim distribution is great, but you’re at the mercy of individual plugin authors. Sometimes, for example, folke disappears for months - and he alone maintains the majority of plugins that most modern Neovim configurations depend on. One person maintaining critical infrastructure is a single point of failure. This is absolutely no shame on folke - he’s doing amazing work for free - but this is just how open source works.\nPlugin updates break things. You spend time maintaining your config instead of actually coding. Debugging and task running still feel like second-class citizens compared to IDEs.\nSome pain points that IDEs handle better:\nDebugging experience Collaborative coding UI flexibility (terminal constraints are real) Long-term maintenance by dedicated teams vs. solo maintainers My verdict 📔 Both are great. Both are fast. Both are open source.\nZed is easier to use and maintain. Neovim is more powerful and customizable.\nFor now, I’m using both. Doing quick edits still feels easier in Neovim. Zed when I want to spend a bigger chunk of time on a codebase. I try to keep my LazyVim and Zed keymaps similar, so I don’t have to think too much about which editor I’m using.\nThe best editor is the one that gets out of your way. Sometimes that’s Neovim. Sometimes it’s Zed.\nFor my configurations, check out:\nZed config Neovim config ",

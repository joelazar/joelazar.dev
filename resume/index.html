<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m working as a Backend Engineer at raffle.ai where I&rsquo;m continuously trying to improve our awesome products backend services.</p>
<p>Before that I had worked for two big European companies for five years, where I could try myself in different fields. At Continental I had the chance to work on a front facing camera development based on AI technologies and at Nokia I was part of a huge global team which was across four different countries (Greece, USA, India and Hungary). There I worked on a cloud native mobile core network development.</p>
<p>My main competencies are Go, Python, C / C++, network protocols and Unix. However, I&rsquo;m always open to use the most suitable tools for a job.</p>
<p>When I’m not on the job, I like to sport, especially to run or cycle to new places. And of course, as I&rsquo;m a proud fox-terrier owner, I enjoy taking long walks with my dog as well :)</p>

<p>I had worked on Continental&rsquo;s new generation front facing camera development. My main responsibilities was to develop and extend the software component for the embedded hardware and test the newly trained convolutional neural networks on our test environment. Six months after I was hired I got nominated to be the component owner of our software as well and with this I became responsible for software design choices and organizing the work within our small development group of five people.</p>

<p>After spending two years on this project I became pretty familiar with the whole product itself. Beside my implementation duties I was frequently taking part in software design discussions and have and important role of investigating customer issues. I&rsquo;ve been in India for three weeks also for supporting one of Nokia&rsquo;s key customer to help them setup our software to their core network. Since then this operator was able to go <a href="https://www.bgr.in/news/vodafone-4g-volte-now-live-in-mumbai-gujarat-and-delhi-heres-how-to-activate-on-your-smartphone/">live</a>. During this period I extended my skills with new languages like Golang and Perl. Also, I&rsquo;ve created and maintained a Gitlab CI pipeline for our loadbalancer solutions.</p>

<p><code>2015. feb - 2017. oct</code></p>
<p>I was working on a project which was about how can a network element&rsquo;s software transform to become a cloud native one. This is called <a href="https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/telecom-application-server/">Nokia TAS</a>. The challenge was heavy because the legacy software was written to a special OS called DMX and it had to be converted to Linux to enable us to containerize the applications. My main responsibilities were the load balancers for HTTP and other interfaces and also how the business logic services should work with those. At my daily work I mainly used C/C++, Python, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes and Tnsdl. As for cloud at the beginning we used Eucalyptus (which is a AWS-compatible private cloud solution) and later we changed to OpenStack, which enabled us a bit more flexibility for cluster customizations.</p>

<p>Title: An auto-catalytic reaction-diffusion equation&rsquo;s numerical analysis</p>
<p>Supervisor: Associate Professor, János Karátson</p>
<p>Description: A reaction-diffusion equation is a special partial differential equation which models the concentration of the chemical substances in a reaction. The equation that I am analyzing is in a steady state. It was mentioned in a mathematics book which was published in the middle of the 80’s. My analysis is about in which case can the equation be solved and I am trying to approximate the solution with finite element method. I&rsquo;ve implemented the solution analyzed the results in Matlab.

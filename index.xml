      <description>Finally, I managed to update my dotfiles today and change for chezmoi for managing them properly. It took a bit of time, but I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the result now. If you are interested you can find them here.</description>

      <description>Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working as a Backend Engineer at raffle.ai where I&amp;rsquo;m continuously trying to improve our awesome products backend services.
Before that I had worked for two big European companies for five years, where I could try myself in different fields. At Continental I had the chance to work on a front facing camera development based on AI technologies and at Nokia I was part of a huge global team which was across four different countries (Greece, USA, India and Hungary).</description>
